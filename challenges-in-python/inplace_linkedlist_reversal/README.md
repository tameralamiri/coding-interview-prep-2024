# In-Place Reversal of a Linked List Pattern:
The In-place Reversal of a Linked List pattern involves reversing the nodes of a linked list directly, rather than using additional data structures like arrays or stacks. This pattern is efficient in terms of space as it manipulates the existing nodes to reverse the list.

## How it Works:
* Traverse the linked list and, while doing so, change the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node.

## When to Use:
This pattern is useful when you need to reverse a linked list or a part of it. It is a fundamental technique in linked list problems and has applications in more complex scenarios, such as:

* Reversing a certain portion of a linked list.
* Problems involving palindromes in a linked list.

## Example Challenges:
1. Reverse a Linked List: Reverse the entire linked list.
2. Reverse Sub-list: Reverse a part of the linked list, from position m to n.
3. Reverse Nodes in k-Group: Reverse nodes in a linked list in groups of size k.

## Real-Life Applications:
* In-place list reversal is often used in systems or applications where memory efficiency is critical, as it requires constant space.
* Can be used in undo functionalities in applications, where operations are stored in a linked list and need to be reversed.
