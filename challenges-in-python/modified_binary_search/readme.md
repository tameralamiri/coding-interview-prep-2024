# Modified Binary Search Pattern
The Modified Binary Search pattern involves tweaking the classic binary search algorithm to handle more complex scenarios beyond just finding an element in a sorted array. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to find an element that meets a specific condition that binary search can be adapted to solve.

## How It Works:
* Classic Binary Search: Involves repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
* Modified Binary Search: Adapts this approach to various conditions, such as finding the first or last occurrence of an element, searching for the closest value, or finding the entry point for a cyclically sorted array.

## When to Use:
This pattern is useful in scenarios like:

* Finding the first or last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.
* Searching in a partially sorted or cyclically sorted array.
* Finding the closest element to a target in a sorted array.
* Solving problems that can be reduced to a binary search, even if they don't directly involve searching a sorted array.

## Example Challenges:
1. Search in a Rotated Array: Given a sorted array that has been rotated, find a particular element.
2. Find the Smallest Letter Greater Than Target: Given a list of sorted characters and a target character, find the smallest character in the list that is larger than the target.
3. Find Peak Element: Given an array of integers where the array is first increasing and then decreasing, find the peak element.
4. Search for a Range: Given a sorted array and a target value, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

## Real-Life Applications:
1. Database Queries: Optimizing range queries to quickly find records that match certain criteria.
2. File Systems: Searching for files or entries based on specific attributes or conditions.
3. Network Routing: Finding optimal paths or routes based on sorted metrics or conditions.
