# Matrices Pattern
The Matrices pattern involves solving problems that deal with 2D arrays or grids. This pattern is useful in a wide range of problems, from simple traversals to complex dynamic programming. Operations on matrices include traversal, rotation, modification based on conditions, path finding, and applying specific algorithms to manage or transform the matrix data.

## When to Use:
This pattern is applicable when working with:

* Multidimensional data representation.
* Graphs represented as adjacency matrices.
* Image processing tasks.
* Dynamic programming problems that require 2D states.
* Simulation problems where the state evolves based on the matrix's configuration.

## Example Challenges:
1. Rotate Image: Rotate the image (2D matrix) by 90 degrees.
2. Spiral Matrix: Traverse the matrix in a spiral order.
3. Word Search: Search for a word in a 2D grid of letters.
4. Set Matrix Zeros: Given a matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.
5. Maximal Rectangle: Find the largest rectangle containing only 1's in a 2D binary matrix.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Computer Graphics: Operations like rotation and scaling of images.
* Geographical Information Systems (GIS): Handling spatial data in grid formats.
* Machine Learning: Handling 2D feature matrices for algorithms.
