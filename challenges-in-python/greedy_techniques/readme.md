# Greedy Techniques
Greedy techniques are a class of algorithmic solutions that build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit or optimization. The greedy approach makes decisions from the given solution domain according to some selection criteria, hoping to find the global optimum by making locally optimal choices at each step.

## How It Works:
* Greedy algorithms work by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
* They do not generally provide an optimal solution for all problems but do so for a wide range of problems where the greedy choice property and optimal substructure property are present.

## When to Use:
Greedy techniques are best suited for problems where making locally optimal choices leads to a globally optimal solution. They are often used when:

* A problem has "optimal substructure," meaning the solution to a problem can be constructed optimally from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
* A problem exhibits the "greedy choice property," meaning local optimal solutions can be combined to form a global optimum.

## Example Challenges:
1. Activity Selection Problem: Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
2. Huffman Coding: Efficient data compression technique that assigns variable length codes to input characters, with shorter codes for more frequent characters.
3. Fractional Knapsack Problem: Maximize the total value in the knapsack, allowing the breaking of items for a fractional part.
4. Jump Game: Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Determine if you can reach the last index.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Resource Allocation: Where there are constraints on resources, and an optimal allocation is needed.
* Network Routing: Finding the most efficient path or routing for data packets.
* Scheduling Problems: For example, scheduling jobs on machines.
