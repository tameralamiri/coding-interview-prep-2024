# Backtracking
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time. It's particularly useful for solving constraint satisfaction problems such as parsing, knapsack, and combinatorial problems.

## How It Works:
* Choose: Make a choice from the options available at the current step.
* Constrain: Apply constraints to reduce the number of choices.
* Goal: Check if the current choices lead to a solution.
* Backtrack: If the current choice doesn't lead to a solution or violates constraints, undo the last choice (backtrack) and try another option.

## When to Use:
This pattern is effective when the solution space is large and you need to search through the possibilities to find all solutions that meet certain criteria. It's used when:

* Enumeration of all possible candidates for the solution is complex.
* The solution space is unknown or dynamic.

## Example Challenges:
1. N-Queens: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
2. Permutations: Find all permutations of a given set/string.
3. Combination Sum: Find combinations in a set that sum to a particular value.
4. Sudoku Solver: Fill a Sudoku board by respecting its constraints.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Puzzle Solving: Games like Sudoku, crosswords, and other logic puzzles.
* Pathfinding: In robotics and navigation systems.
* AI in Games: Determining moves in games like chess or Go.
