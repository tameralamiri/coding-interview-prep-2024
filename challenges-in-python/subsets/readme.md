# Subsets Pattern
The Subsets pattern involves dealing with problems that require generating all possible subsets (combinations) of a set, often leading to solutions that use recursion, backtracking, or iterative approaches to explore all potential combinations.

## How It Works:
* Recursion/Backtracking: You can solve subset problems by considering two cases for each element: either including the element in the current subset or not. Recursively solve for each case.
* Iterative: Start with an empty set, and for each element, add it to existing subsets to form new subsets.
* Bit Manipulation: Each subset can be represented by a bit mask of length equal to the number of elements, where each bit represents whether an element is included in the subset.

## When to Use:
This pattern is applicable when you need to explore all the combinations or arrangements of a set of elements, such as:

* Generating all subsets of a set.
* Generating all permutations of a set.
* Problems requiring the exploration of all possible combinations of decisions.

## Example Challenges:
1. Subsets: Generate all subsets of a given set of integers.
2. Permutations: Generate all possible permutations of a sequence.
3. Combinations: Generate all combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.
4. Letter Case Permutation: Given a string, generate all permutations of the string by changing the case of its letters.

## Real-Life Applications:
Power Set in Set Theory: In mathematics, generating the power set (the set of all subsets) of a set.
Feature Selection: In machine learning, exploring subsets of features for model training.
Problem Solving: In puzzles and games, exploring all possible states or moves.
