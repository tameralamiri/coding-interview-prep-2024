# Merge Intervals Pattern Explained
The Merge Intervals pattern is used to deal with overlapping intervals or time slots. In this pattern, you are given a collection of intervals, and your task is often to merge the overlapping intervals.

## How it Works:
* Sorting: The intervals are often sorted based on their start times.
* Merging: Iterate through the sorted intervals and, for each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one. If it does, merge them; otherwise, add it to the output list.

## When to Use:
This pattern is useful in scenarios such as:

* Scheduling problems (e.g., meeting rooms scheduling).
* Time range consolidation.

## Example Challenges:
1. Merge Overlapping Intervals: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
2. Insert Interval: Given a set of non-overlapping intervals and a new interval, insert the interval at the correct position.
3. Meeting Rooms: Determine if a person could attend all meetings.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Calendar/event scheduling in software applications.
* Resource allocation in operating systems or cloud computing.
