# Stacks Pattern:
Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming, characterized by their Last In, First Out (LIFO) access policy. This pattern is incredibly versatile and can be used to solve a wide range of problems that require temporary storage and retrieval of data in a specific order.

## How It Works:
* Push Operation: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
* Pop Operation: Removes the top element from the stack.
* Peek Operation: Returns the top element without removing it, allowing a look at the current last-in item.

## When to Use:
The stack pattern is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

* Balancing Symbols: Checking for balanced parentheses, brackets, etc., in an expression.
* Undo Mechanisms: Storing previous states in applications for undo functionality.
* Function Calls: Managing function calls in programming languages, where the call stack is a stack.
* String Parsing: Parsing expressions or algorithms like infix to postfix conversion.
* Depth-First Search (DFS): In graph algorithms, using a stack can help manage the nodes being visited.

## Example Challenges:
1. Valid Parentheses: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
2. Basic Calculator: Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string containing non-negative integers, '+', '-', '*', '/', and parentheses.
3. Largest Rectangle in Histogram: Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
4. Daily Temperatures: Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Web Browsers: Managing visited pages for forward and backward navigation.
* Text Editors: Undo functionality in text editors uses stacks to keep track of changes.
* Syntax Checking: Compilers use stacks for syntax checking and parsing.
