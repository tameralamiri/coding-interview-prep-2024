# Two Heaps Pattern Explained
The Two Heaps pattern involves using two priority queues (heaps): a min-heap and a max-heap. It's a powerful technique for solving problems that require managing a set of elements divided into two parts based on a certain criterion, enabling efficient queries for the median of the dataset or other such statistics.

## How It Works:
* Min-Heap: Stores the half of the elements that are greater than the median. The smallest element (the next greater than the median) is always at the top.
* Max-Heap: Stores the half of the elements that are less than or equal to the median. The largest element (the median or the closest lower value) is always at the top.
* Balancing the heaps: It's crucial to maintain the heaps in a balanced state, with either equal sizes or one heap having one more element than the other.

## When to Use:
This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to continually calculate a median or need quick access to the median elements of a dataset as it grows.

## Example Challenges:
1. Find the Median of a Number Stream (Median Finder): Dynamically finding the median of a stream of numbers.
2. Sliding Window Median: Finding the median of every subarray of size k in a given array.
3. Maximize Capital: Given a set of projects with their capitals and profits, find the maximum total capital after completing at most k projects.
4. Merge K Sorted Lists: Merge multiple sorted lists into one large sorted list.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Financial applications, like managing streams of stock prices and calculating rolling medians.
* Real-time analytics, where quick access to median values (like median response times) is necessary.
* Resource allocation in simulations and gaming, where balancing based on priorities is key.
