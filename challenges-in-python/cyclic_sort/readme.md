# Cyclic Sort:
Cyclic Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works by placing elements in their correct indexes based on the assumption that the array contains elements in a range from 1 to n or 0 to n-1. It's particularly useful for problems where you need to sort an array to find missing or duplicate numbers in a constrained range.

## How It Works:
* Start from the first element, and compare it to its correct index (e.g., for 1-based indexing, an element 1 should be at index 0, and for 0-based indexing, element 0 should be at index 0).
* If the element is not in its correct position, swap it with the element that is currently in its correct position.
* Continue this process for each element until the array is sorted.

## When to Use:
This pattern is ideal for problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range where you're asked to find missing or duplicate numbers. It's used when:

* The array elements are integers in a specific range.
* You need to optimize the space complexity, as Cyclic Sort sorts in-place with O(1) extra space.

## Example Challenges:
1. Find the Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing.
2. Find All Missing Numbers: From an unsorted array containing numbers taken from a given range, find all the numbers missing in the range.
3. Find the Duplicate Number: Find a duplicate number in an array containing n+1 integers between 1 and n.
4. Find the First K Missing Positive Numbers: Given an unsorted array containing numbers and a number k, find the first k missing positive numbers in the array.

## Real-Life Applications:
* Data Validation: Checking for missing or duplicate entries in datasets.
* Memory Management: Identifying gaps or overlaps in memory allocation units.
