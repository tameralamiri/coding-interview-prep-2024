# K-way Merge Pattern:
The K-way Merge pattern is an algorithmic approach used to efficiently merge multiple sorted lists or arrays into a single sorted list or array. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you're dealing with multiple sets of sorted data and you need to maintain the sorted order when merging them together.

## When to Use It
1. Merging Sorted Arrays or Lists: When you have multiple sorted arrays or lists and you need to merge them into a single sorted structure.
2. Streaming Data: In situations where you receive sorted streams of data in chunks and need to merge them in real-time while keeping the data sorted.
3. External Sort: Used in external sorting algorithms where large datasets that don't fit into memory are sorted in chunks and then merged.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Merge K Sorted Lists or Arrays.
* Find the Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists.
* Merge K Sorted Iterators.

## Real-Life Applications
* Distributed Systems: Merging logs from multiple sources into a single chronologically ordered log.
* Database Systems: Implementations of external sorting algorithms for large datasets.
* Big Data Processing: Merging data from multiple sorted chunks in map-reduce operations.
