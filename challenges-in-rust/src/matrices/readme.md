# Matrices Pattern:
The Matrices pattern involves solving problems that require manipulation or analysis of matrix data structures, typically 2D arrays. This pattern is common in algorithms that deal with spatial data, image processing, dynamic programming, and graph problems represented as adjacency matrices.

## When to Use It
1. Spatial Problems: When the problem involves spatial relationships that can be naturally mapped to a grid or 2D matrix.
2. Graph Problems: When a graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, and you need to perform operations like finding paths or connected components.
3. Dynamic Programming: Some DP problems use matrices for memoization or tabulation.
4. Image Processing: Operations on images, where pixels can be represented as a 2D matrix.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Rotate Image: Rotate the image (matrix) by 90 degrees.
* Set Matrix Zeros: Given a matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.
* Spiral Matrix: Traverse and return elements of the matrix in spiral order.
* Word Search: Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

## Real-Life Applications
* Image Processing: Applying filters or transformations to images.
* Game Development: Representing and manipulating game boards or levels.
* Pathfinding Algorithms: Used in navigation systems, games, and robotics.
* Data Visualization: Heat-maps and other matrix-based visualizations.
