# In-place Reversal of a Linked List: Explanation
The "In-place Reversal of a Linked List" pattern is a common algorithmic approach used in problems involving linked lists. This technique involves reversing a linked list by modifying the pointers of the nodes in place, without using extra space for another list.

## When to Use It
1. Reversing a Linked List: The primary application is to reverse the entire or part of a linked list.
2. Palindrome Linked List: To check if a linked list is a palindrome by reversing the second half and comparing it with the first half.
3. Rearranging a Linked List: In problems where you need to change the order of nodes, like in the case of sorting or partitioning.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Reverse a Linked List.
* Find the Middle of a Linked List (can involve reversal).
* Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome.
* Reverse Sub-list within a Linked List.

## Real-Life Applications
* Undo functionality in text editors: Linked lists can represent the state of the document, and reversing can help in traversing changes backward.
* Navigating browser history: Where the most recent page is at the front of a linked list.
