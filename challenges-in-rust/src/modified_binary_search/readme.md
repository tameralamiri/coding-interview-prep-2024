# Modified Binary Search:
The Modified Binary Search pattern is an extension of the classic binary search algorithm. It's used in scenarios where the problem can be reduced to a binary search but doesn't directly involve searching for an element in a sorted array. This pattern is particularly useful for problems that require finding an element or condition that meets a specific criterion in a sorted dataset or when the solution space is logically ordered.

## When to Use It
1. Finding Boundaries: Useful for finding the first or last occurrence of a number in a sorted array or the boundary where conditions change (e.g., first number greater than a given value).
2. Search in Rotated Array: When dealing with a sorted array that has been rotated, and you need to find an element.
3. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days: Problems where you need to minimize or maximize a certain condition to meet specific criteria.
4. Minimize Maximum of a Function: In scenarios where you need to minimize the maximum value of a function under certain constraints.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Find the first or last position of an element in a sorted array.
* Search in a rotated sorted array.
* Find the minimum in a rotated sorted array.
* Find peak element in an array.
* Allocate minimum number of pages.

## Real-Life Applications
* Search Systems: Implementing efficient search in sorted datasets, such as in databases or file systems.
* Resource Allocation: Determining optimal resource allocation that meets specific constraints, like bandwidth or memory usage.
* Load Balancing: Adjusting requests or tasks among servers to minimize the maximum load.
