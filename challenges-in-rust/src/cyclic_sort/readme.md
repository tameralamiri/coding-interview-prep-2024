# Cyclic Sort:
Cyclic Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that is optimal for situations where the input is a range of integers from 1 to n or 0 to n-1. The key idea behind Cyclic Sort is to place each number in its correct index based on the value of the number, making it particularly efficient for sorting numbers with a known range.

## When to Use It
1. Array contains numbers in a given range: When the elements are integers within a specific range.
2. Need to minimize space complexity: Since it sorts in-place, it doesn't require any extra storage.
3. Optimizing time complexity for specific ranges: It can sort in linear time under the right conditions.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Find the Missing Number: In an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0 to n, find the one that is missing.
* Find All Duplicates in an Array: Without extra space and in O(n) time.
* Find the Duplicate Number: Given an array numbers containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive).
* First Missing Positive: Find the smallest missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.

## Real-Life Applications
* Data Stream Validation: Quickly determining if data packets numbered sequentially are missing in a stream.
* Database Integrity Checks: Ensuring there are no gaps in sequential numeric identifiers.
* Memory Management: Identifying missing or duplicate memory addresses or identifiers in a predefined range.
