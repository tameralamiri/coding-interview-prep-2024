# Two Heaps Pattern: Explanation
The Two Heaps pattern is a powerful technique used in problems where you need to keep track of elements divided into two parts and want to find a median, or simply need to manage two groups with direct access to their extreme elements (minimum or maximum).

## When to Use It
1. Finding the Median of a Data Stream: When you need to continuously return the median of a growing dataset.
2. Managing Streams of Data: Especially when you need quick access to the smallest or largest elements, based on certain conditions.
3. Maximize Capital: For problems where you need to perform operations based on the smallest or largest elements from two sets, like choosing projects with capital and profits considerations.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Find Median from Data Stream.
* Sliding Window Median.
* Maximize Capital (Given several projects with different capital requirements and profits, find out the maximum total capital after completing at most k projects).
* Merge K Sorted Lists.

## Real-Life Applications
* Financial Applications: Managing investments, where you might want to pick investments based on their returns and available capital.
* Real-time Data Processing: Where medians or other statistics are calculated on-the-fly for streams of data.
* Task Scheduling: Prioritizing tasks based on resources and benefits.
