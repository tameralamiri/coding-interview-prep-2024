# Greedy Techniques:
Greedy techniques are algorithmic approaches where the best choice is made at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. The key idea behind greedy algorithms is to choose the locally optimal solution at each step, aiming for the overall optimal solution to the problem without reconsidering previous choices.

## When to Use It
1. Optimization Problems: Greedy algorithms are best suited for problems where a series of choices are made to reach an optimal solution, and making the locally optimal choice also leads to a global optimum.
2. Scheduling Problems: When you need to schedule tasks or resources with constraints.
3. Selection Problems: For selecting subsets from a collection based on certain criteria.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Jump Game: Determine if you can reach the last index of the array.
* Coin Change: Find the minimum number of coins that make a given value.
* Fractional Knapsack: Maximize the value of items that can fit in a knapsack.
* Activity Selection: Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

## Real-Life Applications
* Resource Allocation: Allocating resources in a way that maximizes the efficiency or minimizes the cost.
* Network Routing: Choosing paths in networking to optimize speed and reduce latency.
* Compression Techniques: Huffman coding, where frequently occurring items are given short codes.
