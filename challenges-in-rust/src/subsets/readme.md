# Subsets Pattern:
The Subsets pattern involves generating all possible subsets (also known as power sets) from a given set or list. This pattern is particularly useful in problems where you need to explore all combinations or arrangements of a collection, often to satisfy certain conditions or perform exhaustive search.

## When to Use It
1. Combinatorial Problems: When you need to generate all possible combinations or arrangements of a set.
2. Permutations and Combinations: Specific cases of subsets, where order matters (permutations) or does not matter (combinations).
3. Decision Making: In scenarios where you have to make a series of decisions or selections from a set of options.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Generating all subsets of a set.
* Permutations of a collection of numbers.
* Combinations of k numbers out of 1...n.
* Letter Case Permutation (e.g., generating all case variations of a string).

## Real-Life Applications
* Feature Selection: In machine learning, selecting combinations of features to find the best performing model.
* Task Scheduling: Generating all possible schedules to find the optimal one.
* Security: Generating all possible keys in certain encryption schemes.
