# Topological Sort:
Topological Sort is an algorithm used on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to linearly order the vertices such that for every directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. This sorting is particularly useful in situations where you need to determine an order of tasks while respecting all the prerequisite conditions.

## When to Use It
1. Determining Dependencies: When you need to order tasks or events based on their dependencies.
2. Scheduling Jobs: In scenarios where jobs have prerequisites (like in build systems or course scheduling).
3. Serializing Instructions: Ensuring that instructions are executed in an order that respects their dependencies.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Course Schedule: Determine if it's possible to finish all courses given prerequisite pairs.
* Alien Dictionary: Find the order of characters in an alien language given a sorted list of words.
* Minimum Height Trees: For a tree-like graph, find the roots of the minimum height trees.
* Compilation Order: Determine the order in which files should be compiled based on their dependencies.

## Real-Life Applications
* Build Systems: Determining the order in which source files should be compiled.
* Package Managers: Installing packages in an order that respects their inter-dependencies.
* Task Scheduling: Organizing tasks or projects that have specific prerequisite requirements.
