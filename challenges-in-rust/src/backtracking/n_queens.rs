// Solving the "N-Queens" Challenge
// Problem Statement
// The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard 
// such that no two queens attack each other. 
// Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

// Big O:
// Time complexity: O(n!) | Space complexity: O(n^2)

// Check if a queen can be placed on board[row][col]
// This function is called when "col" queens are already placed in columns from 0 to col -1.
// So we need to check only left side for attacking queens
