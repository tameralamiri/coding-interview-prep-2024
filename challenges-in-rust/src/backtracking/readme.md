# Backtracking:
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time. It's often applied in situations where a brute-force enumeration of all possible solutions is impractical.

## When to Use It
1. Combinatorial Problems: Where you need to explore sets of combinations or permutations to find those that satisfy certain conditions.
2. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): Such as puzzle solving or scheduling tasks where constraints must be met.
3. Exploring Decision Trees: In scenarios where decisions lead to new sets of choices and constraints.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* N-Queens: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
* Permutations/Combinations: Generate all possible permutations or combinations of a set.
* Subset Sum: Find subsets that sum up to a particular value.
* Word Search: Search for a word in a grid of letters.

## Real-Life Applications
* Puzzle Games: Solving puzzles like Sudoku.
* Pathfinding: In robotics or game development, finding paths that meet certain criteria.
* Automated Reasoning: In artificial intelligence, for proving theorems or logic programming.
