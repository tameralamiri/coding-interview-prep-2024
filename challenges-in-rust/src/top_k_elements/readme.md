# Top K Elements Pattern: Explanation
The Top K Elements pattern is utilized in problems where you need to find a certain number of elements that meet a specific criterion from a set of elements, such as the largest or smallest, or those that appear most frequently. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or streams of data where it's not feasible or necessary to sort the entire dataset to find these elements.

## When to Use It
1. Finding the Largest or Smallest Elements: When you need to find the k largest or k smallest elements in an array or stream.
2. Frequency Sorting: When sorting elements by frequency of occurrence and you're interested in the top k frequent elements.
3. Running Streams: When dealing with a continuous stream of data and you need to maintain the top k elements in real-time.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Kth Largest Element in an Array.
* Top K Frequent Elements.
* K Closest Points to Origin.
* Kth Largest Element in a Stream.

## Real-Life Applications
* E-Commerce: Displaying top k selling products in real-time on an e-commerce platform.
* Social Media: Showing the top k trending topics or hashtags based on user activity.
* Analytics: In data analytics, finding the top k metrics from a dataset for reporting and visualization.
