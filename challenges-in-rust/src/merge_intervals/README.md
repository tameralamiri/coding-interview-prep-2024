# Merge Intervals Pattern:
The Merge Intervals pattern is a technique often used in problems involving ranges or intervals. It usually involves combining overlapping intervals into a single one. This pattern is helpful when you need to perform operations on these intervals, such as finding overlaps, merging, or finding gaps.

## When to Use It
1. Merging Overlapping Intervals: When given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals into one.
2. Finding Overlaps in Intervals: To determine if any intervals overlap in a given set.
3. Maximizing or Minimizing Certain Properties: For example, finding the maximum number of rooms required for meetings based on their time intervals.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Merge Overlapping Intervals.
* Find the Minimum Number of Meeting Rooms Required.
* Insert Interval into a Set of Non-overlapping Intervals.
* Interval List Intersections.

## Real-Life Applications
* Calendar/Meeting Scheduling Systems: Determining available slots or merging meeting times.
* Resource Allocation in Systems: Merging time-based resource usage data.
* Genomic Research: Working with genomic intervals to find overlapping genes or regions.
