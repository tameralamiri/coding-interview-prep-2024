# Two Pointers Technique:
The two pointers technique is a common approach in algorithmic problem-solving, especially useful in array and linked list problems. The basic idea is to use two variables (pointers) to traverse the data structure, typically in opposite directions or at different speeds. This technique can help reduce the time complexity, often from O(n²) to O(n).

## When to Use Two Pointers
The two pointers technique is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

1. Searching for a pair in a sorted array: When you need to find a pair of elements that meet certain criteria (like having a specific sum), two pointers can efficiently explore the array from both ends.

2. Finding subarrays with a specific property: Like in sliding window problems, where you might want to find the longest or shortest subarray that satisfies certain conditions.

3. Reversing an array or linked list: By placing one pointer at the start and another at the end and then swapping their elements.

4. Detecting cycles: In linked lists, using a fast and a slow pointer can help detect cycles.

Example: Checking for Palindrome
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Using the two pointers technique, we can check for a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends of the string and moving towards the center.

# Does my problem match this pattern?
* Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:
  * The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s in an array, in a linked list, or in a string of characters.

  * We limit our focus to a specific range of elements within the input data, as dictated by the positions of the two pointers, allowing us to consider a small subset of elements rather than the entire set.

Additionally, problems in this pattern usually involve comparing or swapping values pointed to by two indexes. In less common cases, each index may move along a separate array or string.

* No, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
  * The input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s neither in an array, nor in a linked list, nor in a string of characters.
  * The problem requires an exhaustive search of the solution space, that is, eliminating one solution does not eliminate any others.

# Real-world problems
Many problems in the real world use the two pointers pattern. Let’s look at some examples.

* Memory management: Two pointers are vital in memory allocation and deallocation. The memory pool is initialized with two pointers: the start pointer, pointing to the beginning of the available memory block, and the end pointer, indicating the end of the block. When a process or data structure requests memory allocation, the start pointer is moved forward, designating a new memory block for allocation. Conversely, when memory is released (deallocated), the start pointer is shifted backward, marking the deallocated memory as available for future allocations.

* Product suggestions: While shopping online, when customers view their cart and the current total doesn’t qualify for free shipping, we want to show them pairs of products that can be bought together to make the total amount equal to the amount required to be eligible for free delivery. Two pointers can be used to suggest the pairs that add up to the required cost for free shipping.
