# Sliding Window Technique: Explanation
The Sliding Window technique is a method often used in array or string problems to find a continuous subarray or substring that meets certain criteria. This technique involves maintaining a 'window' that can expand or shrink as it slides over the data.

## When to Use It
1. Fixed-Size Window: When the problem asks to find a property (like sum, average, or count) of every subarray of a certain size.

2. Variable-Size Window: When the problem involves finding a subarray or substring that meets a condition and you need to find the smallest or largest one.

## Examples of Coding Challenges
* Maximum/Minimum Sum Subarray of size K.
* Longest substring with K distinct characters.
* String anagrams.
* Smallest subarray with a given sum.

## Real-Life Applications
* Network data analysis, like detecting patterns of usage in a given time window.
* Real-time analytics, where a sliding window can help analyze trends in the latest data.
* Financial analysis, such as calculating moving averages.
